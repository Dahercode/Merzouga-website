## A slow journey to the Sahara

This signature expedition connects Morocco's imperial north with the ocher valleys of the south. We begin in **Casablanca** with a seaside breakfast before driving to Rabat's blue medina and onward to Fes. Local storytellers introduce you to artisans who tan leather, hammer brass, and weave zellij tiles. By day three the road rises into the cedar forests above Ifrane where Berber nomads share mint tea and panoramic views of the Ziz Valley.

### Day-by-day highlights

- **Days 1–2:** Explore Casablanca's Art Deco avenues, Hassan II Mosque, and Rabat's Kasbah des Oudayas before bedding down in Fes.
- **Days 3–4:** Wander the labyrinth of Fes el-Bali, take a cooking class, then cross the Middle Atlas to Midelt.
- **Days 5–6:** Descend into Erfoud's fossil fields, ride camels toward Erg Chebbi, and sleep in a luxury desert camp with live gnawa music.
- **Days 7–8:** Drive through the Todra and Dades gorges, stopping to hike palm groves and photograph clay kasbahs near Skoura.
- **Days 9–10:** Visit Ouarzazate studios, UNESCO-listed Aït Benhaddou, and finish in Marrakech for a farewell feast.

### What to expect

Guides set a relaxed rhythm with time for improvised detours—sunrise tea with an Amazigh family, stargazing with astronomers, or a pottery workshop in Rissani. Transportation alternates between private 4x4 vehicles, short desert hikes, and camel caravans designed for comfort.
