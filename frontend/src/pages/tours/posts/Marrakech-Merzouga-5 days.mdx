## Travel deeper into the south

Five days unlocks extra time in the kasbahs and palm groves between Marrakech and the Sahara. You'll sample saffron in Taliouine, walk oases in Skoura, and sip tea with nomads near Erfoud before spending two nights around Merzouga.

### Highlights

- **Cultural immersion:** Discover Amazigh weaving cooperatives, cinema sets in Ouarzazate, and the earthen fortress of Aït Benhaddou.
- **Nature time:** Hike the Todra Gorge, plant a palm tree with a local association, and climb a golden dune for sunset.
- **Desert comforts:** Sleep in riads with plunge pools plus a spacious desert camp featuring private bathrooms and stargazing telescopes.

1. Marrakech → Aït Benhaddou → Skoura
2. Skoura → Rose Valley → Dades Canyon
3. Dades → Erfoud → Merzouga camp (sunset camel trek)

5. Return via Alnif and the High Atlas, arriving Marrakech by evening
