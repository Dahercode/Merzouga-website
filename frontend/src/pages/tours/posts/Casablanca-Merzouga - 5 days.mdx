## Why travelers love this loop

Five days are enough to dive into Morocco's contrasting landscapes. We trade Casablanca's skyline for Meknes vineyards and the labyrinth of Fes before descending through cedar forests to Erfoud and Merzouga. Private drivers keep the pace smooth so you can focus on scenery and storytelling.

### Sample schedule

1. **Casablanca → Fes:** Morning visit of Hassan II Mosque followed by train or chauffeured drive to Fes for a rooftop dinner.
2. **Medina immersion:** Meet artisans in the Nejjarine quarter, visit madrasas, and taste freshly baked khobz.
3. **Atlas to Erfoud:** Cross Ifrane and Midelt, pausing for cedar picnics and Ziz Valley panoramas.
4. **Merzouga desert camp:** Camel ride at sunset, gnawa performance, and candlelit dinner among the dunes.
5. **Return journey:** Breakfast in camp, 4x4 transfer to Errachidia, then flight or drive back toward Casablanca or Marrakech.

### Insider tips

- Pack layers—the Atlas mornings are crisp even in summer.
- Upgrade to a sunrise hot-air balloon for aerial views over the dunes.
- Add an extra night in Fes if you want a hammam ritual or ceramics workshop.

### What's included

Transportation, camel trek, accommodation in riads and a deluxe camp, breakfasts, and two dinners are bundled. Local guides join in Fes and at the desert camp to personalize every moment.
