## The perfect long-weekend

This itinerary is crafted for travelers who want maximum desert time without rushing. Leave Marrakech early to climb the Tizi n'Tichka pass, trade the red city for Ouarzazate's film studios, and reach the dunes of Erg Chebbi just in time for sunset.

### Route snapshot

- **Day 1:** Marrakech → High Atlas → Aït Benhaddou → Ouarzazate. Visit kasbahs, taste saffron tagines, and arrive in the Dades Valley for the night.
- **Day 2:** Continue via Tinghir and the Todra Gorge, then swap the minibus for camels to ride into Merzouga camp.
- **Day 3:** Wake for sunrise, sand-board down the dunes, and return to Marrakech with scenic stops in the Atlas villages.

### What's included

Private transportation, bilingual driver-guide, camel caravan, deluxe desert camp with ensuite tents, two breakfasts, and two dinners. Upgrade options include quad biking or an astronomy session with a local guide.
